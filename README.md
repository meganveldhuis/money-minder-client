# Budget App

## Overview

What is your app? Give a brief description in a couple of sentences.

### Problem Space

Why is your app needed? Give any background information around any pain points or other reasons.

I've never found a budget app or spreadsheet that is perfect. I want the option to add expenses offline, have separate trip expenses, and currencies.

### User Profile

- Anyone who's looking for a place to budget and track cash.
- My app will include different users so that if we share a database, they can only see their data.
  <!-- TODO: idrk how multiple users will work cause they shouldnt all be on my SQL database cause then i can see it...  -->
  <!-- TODO: Maybe this is a stretch goal instead... -->
  Who will use your app? How will they use it? Add any special considerations that your app must take into account.
